My journey took root at Fergusson College, Pune, where I earned my master's degree. That's where my love affair with the world of tech really took flight, and since then, I've been hooked on learning and exploring the ever-evolving landscape of web development.

When I'm not coding away, I'm probably diving into the latest tech blogs, exploring innovative design trends, or simply seeking out new learning opportunities. I thrive on the thrill of problem-solving and the joy of creating something impactful.

I'm here to connect, learn, and explore, so feel free to reach out. Let's dive into the world of code and design together!
